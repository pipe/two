# PodCall - a remote interview recording app.

## Features
1) Simple - send a link your guest opens on their smartphone
2) You focus on your interview
3) FREE + opensource
4) Audio quality is better than PSTN, skype, Zoom etc 
5) Recording is premixed into stereo for easy editing 
6) All done in the browser no app to download or install for your guest - or you

### NOTE - This is BETA quality software, it might break, lose your recordings, frighten your cat etc...

## Requirements
### Host needs to use Chrome (on a laptop or Android).
### The guest can use Safari on iOS or Chrome on Android

## How to use it as a Host

1) Make a an appointment with the guest.
2) Just before the interview, browse to https://pipe.github.io/podcall/ 
this creates a link, 
3) share the link with your guest (I screenshot the QR and email it).
But you can use twitter, SMS whatever works for you and your guest
4) Click 'Done' - allow Microphone use and wait for the guest to join.
5) The guest opens the link, accepts the call and enables the microphone use.
(you must click 'Done' before the guest 'Accepts')
6) Talk. 
DON'T CLOSE THE BROWSER TAB - the recording isn't saved until you end the call, so you'll lose audio if
you just nuke the tab!

7) At the end of the call click the square button, then WAIT a few seconds until you see that the audio has been sucessfully saved. 

8) Your browser will save the audio is a .webm file -  Audacity can convert it to WAV if needed.

## Sample note I send to a new Guest:
You'll need 
1) a quiet room
2) a smartphone
3) decent internet

Just before the interview I'll send you a link.
When you get it please open it on your Smartphone. Click 'Accept' to take the call and agree to the dropdown to 
asking for access your microphone, place the phone somewhere comfortable, adjust the speaker volume and just talk. (The mic symbol mutes/unmutes your microphone, the square ends the call). You can use earbuds/headset/airpods if you like.


Enjoy!
